# SuperCode Agent System

This file serves as the primary entry point for the SuperCode framework agent system. All agents follow standardized templates with real capability examples and compliance validation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Recent Template Standardization

All agents now follow a unified template structure ensuring:
- **Template Compliance**: 100% adherence to framework standards
- **Real Examples**: Practical usage scenarios instead of placeholders
- **Standardized Sections**: Consistent frontmatter, triggers, focus areas, and boundaries
- **Validation Ready**: Built-in compliance checking and structure validation

## ðŸ“‹ Agent Categories

### Primary Agents
**Orchestrator** - Central coordination and workflow management

### Engineering Specialists
