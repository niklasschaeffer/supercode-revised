## Enhancement Patterns by Documentation Type

### Agent Documentation Enhancement Pattern

#### Current State Issues
Most agent files are 67-89 lines (need 20-40 additional lines to reach 100-130 range)

#### Enhancement Strategy

**1. Tool Usage Section Expansion (+15-20 lines)**

**Before (Typical Current):**
```markdown
### Primary Tools
- **Read**: Analyze existing system documentation and configuration files
- **Grep**: Search for architectural patterns and dependencies
- **Glob**: Discover system components and artifacts
```

**After (Enhanced):**
```markdown
### Primary Tools
- **Read**: Analyze existing system documentation, configuration files, and architectural diagrams
  - Example: `read_file('architecture/system-design.md')` → Extract current system patterns and constraints
  - Example: `read_file('config/scaling-requirements.yml')` → Understand growth requirements and limitations
  - Example: `read_file('docs/api-contracts.md')` → Analyze service dependencies and integration points

### Command Documentation Enhancement Pattern

#### Current State Issues
Command files range from 47-99 lines (need 1-53 additional lines)

#### Enhancement Strategy

**1. Workflow Section Expansion (+15-25 lines)**

**Before (Typical Current):**
```markdown
## Workflow
- **Analysis Phase**: Assess current memory and in-memoria state
- **Strategy Phase**: Determine cleanup approach based on flags
- **Execution Phase**: Perform selective cleanup while preserving context
- **Validation Phase**: Verify cleanup effectiveness and report metrics
```

**After (Enhanced):**
```markdown
## Workflow
1. **Analysis Phase**: Comprehensive assessment of current memory and in-memoria state
   - `list_memories()` → Discover all available project memories and metadata
   - `get_learning_status()` → Assess current intelligence database state and quality metrics
   - `read_memory('project_overview')` → Understand current project context and recent activities
   - `grep('TODO|FIXME', '**/*.md')` → Identify outdated or completed task references
   - Output: Detailed inventory of cleanup opportunities and data quality assessment

2. **Strategy Phase**: Intelligent cleanup approach determination based on flags and data quality
   - Analyze flag combinations (`--memories-only`, `--in-memoria-only`, `--preserve-recent N`)
   - Calculate data quality scores for memories based on recency and relevance
   - Identify consolidation opportunities between related memories
   - `get_semantic_insights('redundant_patterns')` → Find overlapping or duplicate information
   - Output: Strategic cleanup plan with prioritized actions and preservation rules

3. **Execution Phase**: Selective cleanup execution while preserving high-value context
   - `delete_memory(low_quality_memories)` → Remove outdated or low-relevance content
   - `contribute_insights('consolidated_patterns', {...})` → Merge related information
   - `write_memory('consolidated_overview', enhanced_content)` → Create optimized summaries
   - `get_intelligence_metrics()` → Monitor cleanup progress and effectiveness
   - Output: Cleaned, optimized memory and intelligence database

4. **Validation Phase**: Comprehensive cleanup effectiveness verification and metrics reporting
   - `list_memories()` → Verify cleanup results and new memory organization
   - `get_learning_status()` → Confirm intelligence database optimization
   - Generate cleanup report with before/after metrics
   - Validate preservation of critical context and recent activities
   - Output: Detailed cleanup report with optimization metrics and recommendations
```

**2. Examples Section Expansion (+10-15 lines)**

**Before (Typical Current):**
```markdown
## Examples
```
/cleanup --memories-only --dry-run
/cleanup --in-memoria-only --aggressive
```
```

**After (Enhanced):**
```markdown
## Examples

### Basic Memory Cleanup
```bash
/cleanup --memories-only --dry-run
# Output: Shows what would be cleaned without making changes
# Finds 5 outdated memories, 3 duplicate entries, 2 low-quality items
# Estimated space savings: 40% of current memory usage
```

### Aggressive In-Memoria Optimization
```bash
/cleanup --in-memoria-only --aggressive
# Output: Performs deep optimization of intelligence database
# Consolidates 15 semantic insights into 5 high-quality patterns
# Removes 8 low-confidence learned associations
# Result: 60% reduction in database size, improved query performance
```

### Selective Recent Content Preservation
```bash
/cleanup --preserve-recent 7 --verbose
# Output: Preserves all memories and insights from last 7 days
# Cleans up older content while maintaining recent project context
# Detailed report of cleaned items vs preserved items
# Result: Optimized storage with full recent context retention
```

### Full System Cleanup with Metrics
```bash
/cleanup --full --verbose
# Output: Comprehensive cleanup of both memories and in-memoria data
# Before: 45 memories, 230 insights, 1.2MB total storage
# After: 28 memories, 145 insights, 480KB total storage
# Performance improvement: 40% faster memory queries, 25% faster insights retrieval
```

### Integration with Development Workflow
```bash
/cleanup --preserve-recent 3 && /save
# Output: Cleans up older context, preserves recent development work
# Immediately saves optimized state for next session
# Ensures fast startup times with relevant context pre-loaded
```
```

```

**2. Examples Section Expansion (+15-20 lines)**

**Before (Typical Current):**
```markdown
## Examples
```
"rename getUserData everywhere" → Serena (symbol rename with reference tracking)
"find all references to AuthService" → Serena (semantic symbol search)
```
```

**After (Enhanced):**
```markdown
## Examples

### Symbol Refactoring Workflows
```bash
"rename getUserData to fetchUserData everywhere in the codebase"
→ Serena: find_symbol('getUserData') → find_referencing_symbols() → rename_symbol('fetchUserData')
→ Result: 12 files updated, all imports and references automatically updated
→ Safety: Zero broken references, full type checking maintained

"find all references to AuthService to understand usage patterns before refactoring"
→ Serena: find_referencing_symbols('AuthService', 'src/auth/AuthService.ts')
→ Result: 23 references found across 8 files with usage context
→ Analysis: 15 direct calls, 5 imports, 3 type references
→ Insight: Heavy usage in user management module, careful refactoring required
```

### Code Analysis and Understanding
```bash
"get overview of all symbols in utils.ts to understand available utilities"
→ Serena: get_symbols_overview('src/utils/index.ts')
→ Result: 8 functions, 3 interfaces, 2 types, 1 class
→ Details: Function signatures, parameter types, export status
→ Usage: Informed decision about utility function usage in new feature

"analyze the authentication flow by finding all auth-related symbols"
→ Serena: find_symbol('auth', substring_matching=true) → Multiple symbol discovery
→ Result: AuthService, authenticateUser, AuthMiddleware, AuthToken interfaces
→ Flow: login() → AuthService.authenticateUser() → AuthToken.generate()
→ Insight: Clear authentication pattern with token-based session management
```

### Memory and Documentation Integration
```bash
"store this architectural analysis in project memory for future reference"
→ Serena: write_memory('microservices_analysis', comprehensive_analysis_content)
→ Result: Structured memory with metadata, tags, and searchable content
→ Benefits: Future agents can retrieve this context for consistent decisions
→ Integration: Works with In-Memoria for pattern learning and cross-session persistence

"retrieve previous architectural decisions before making new design choices"
→ Serena: read_memory('architectural_decisions') → Context retrieval
→ Result: Complete history of architectural decisions with rationale
→ Application: New decisions align with established patterns and constraints
→ Consistency: Maintains architectural coherence across development cycles
```

### Complex Multi-Step Operations
```bash
"replace the calculateTotal function body with optimized version while maintaining API"
→ Serena: find_symbol('calculateTotal') → locate exact function
→ Serena: replace_symbol_body('calculateTotal', optimized_implementation) → update logic
→ Serena: find_referencing_symbols('calculateTotal') → verify no breaking changes
→ Result: Performance improved by 40%, all existing integrations work unchanged
→ Validation: Automatic testing of all reference points confirms compatibility

"consolidate duplicate validation logic into shared utility functions"
→ Serena: search_for_pattern('validate.*Required', '**/*.ts') → find validation patterns
→ Serena: analyze duplicates → identify consolidation opportunities
→ Serena: create shared utility → replace_symbol_body() for each duplicate
→ Result: 5 duplicate validations consolidated into 2 reusable utilities
→ Benefits: 60% code reduction, centralized validation logic, easier maintenance
```
```
