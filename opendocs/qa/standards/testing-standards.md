# SuperCode Testing Standards

This document defines the testing standards and procedures for the SuperCode framework.

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

### Quality-First Approach
- **Prevention over Detection**: Build quality in from the start
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical paths and edge cases
- **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing testing throughout development
- **Automated Where Possible**: Reduce manual testing overhead

### Risk-Based Testing
- **Critical Path Priority**: Focus on most important functionality
- **Impact Assessment**: Test based on potential impact of failures
- **Resource Optimization**: Allocate testing effort effectively
- **Regression Prevention**: Protect existing functionality

## 📋 Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing
**Purpose**: Validate individual components in isolation

**Scope**:
- Agent logic and decision-making
- Command parameter handling
- Tool integration points
- Data transformation functions

**Standards**:
- >90% code coverage for critical logic
- Test all public interfaces
- Mock external dependencies
- Include edge case scenarios

### 2. Integration Testing
**Purpose**: Validate component interactions

**Scope**:
- Agent-to-agent communication
- Command-agent coordination
- MCP server integration
- Data flow between components

**Standards**:
- Test all integration points
- Validate data contracts
- Test error propagation
- Include performance validation

### 3. End-to-End Testing
**Purpose**: Validate complete user workflows

**Scope**:
- Complete command executions
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Real-world usage scenarios
- Cross-component functionality

**Standards**:
- Test critical user journeys
- Include real data scenarios
- Validate system behavior
- Test error recovery

### 4. Performance Testing
**Purpose**: Validate system performance characteristics

**Scope**:
- Response time requirements
- Resource utilization limits
- Scalability boundaries
- Memory usage patterns

**Standards**:
- Define performance baselines
- Test under realistic load
- Monitor resource consumption
- Identify performance bottlenecks

### 5. Security Testing
**Purpose**: Validate security controls and protections

**Scope**:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Data protection mechanisms
- Vulnerability assessments

**Standards**:
- Follow security best practices
- Test common vulnerability patterns
- Validate data handling procedures
- Include threat modeling

## 🛠️ Testing Framework Requirements

### Tool Selection
- **Primary Framework**: Jest/Vitest for unit testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for browser automation
- **Integration Testing**: Custom test harness for component testing
- **Performance Testing**: Lighthouse and custom profiling
