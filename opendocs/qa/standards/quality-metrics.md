  - Target: <4 parameters per function
  - Measurement: Average parameters across all functions
  - Impact: Many parameters indicate complex interfaces

## üß™ Testing Metrics

  - Measurement: Functions called / total functions
  - Impact: Ensures all interfaces are tested

### Test Quality Metrics
- **Test Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests passing
  - Target: >95% pass rate
  - Measurement: Passing tests / total tests
  - Impact: Low pass rates indicate quality issues

- **Test Execution Time**: Time to run test suite
  - Target: <5 minutes for full suite
  - Measurement: Total execution time
  - Impact: Long execution times slow development

- **Flaky Test Rate**: Percentage of unreliable tests
  - Target: <2% flaky test rate
  - Measurement: Flaky tests / total tests
  - Impact: Flaky tests reduce confidence in testing

## üìö Documentation Metrics

### Completeness Metrics
- **Documentation Coverage**: Percentage of documented components
  - Target: 100% for public components
  - Measurement: Documented components / total components
  - Impact: Missing documentation reduces usability

- **Example Coverage**: Percentage of components with examples
  - Target: >80% example coverage
  - Measurement: Components with examples / total components
  - Impact: Examples improve understanding and adoption

- **API Documentation**: Percentage of APIs documented
  - Target: 100% for public APIs
  - Measurement: Documented APIs / total APIs
  - Impact: API documentation essential for integration

### Quality Metrics
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Correctness of documentation
  - Target: >95% accuracy
  - Measurement: Correct documentation items / total items
  - Impact: Inaccurate documentation misleads users

- **Documentation Freshness**: Currency of documentation
  - Target: Updated within 30 days of code changes
  - Measurement: Recent documentation / total documentation
  - Impact: Outdated documentation causes confusion

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Code Review Coverage**: Percentage of code reviewed
  - Target: 100% for all changes
  - Measurement: Reviewed changes / total changes
  - Impact: Code reviews improve quality and knowledge sharing

- **Defect Density**: Defects per lines of code
  - Target: <1 defect per 1000 lines
  - Measurement: Total defects / total lines of code
  - Impact: High defect density indicates quality problems

- **Mean Time to Resolution**: Average time to fix issues
  - Target: <3 days for critical issues
  - Measurement: Total resolution time / number of issues
  - Impact: Long resolution times impact user satisfaction

### Release Metrics
- **Release Frequency**: Number of releases per time period
  - Target: Appropriate to project needs
  - Measurement: Releases per month/quarter
  - Impact: Regular releases indicate healthy development

- **Rollback Rate**: Percentage of releases requiring rollback
  - Target: <5% rollback rate
  - Measurement: Rollbacks / total releases
  - Impact: High rollback rates indicate quality issues

- **Deployment Success Rate**: Percentage of successful deployments
  - Target: >95% success rate
  - Measurement: Successful deployments / total deployments
  - Impact: Failed deployments disrupt service

## üë• User Experience Metrics

### Usability Metrics
- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully
  - Target: >90% success rate
  - Measurement: Successful tasks / total tasks
  - Impact: Low success rates indicate usability problems

- **Time to Competency**: Time for users to become productive
  - Target: <2 hours for basic tasks
  - Measurement: Time to complete standard tasks
  - Impact: Long learning curves reduce adoption

- **User Satisfaction**: User rating of framework experience
  - Target: >4.0/5.0 satisfaction score
  - Measurement: User survey scores
