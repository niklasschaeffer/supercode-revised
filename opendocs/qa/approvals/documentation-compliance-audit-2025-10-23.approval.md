#### Priority 2: Agent Documentation (Most files need 20-40 line additions)
- `agent/system-architect.md`: 67 lines (+33 needed)
- `agent/logging.md`: 71 lines (+29 needed)
- `agent/devops-engineer.md`: 72 lines (+28 needed)
- `agent/orchestrator.md`: 171 lines (-41 needed, reduction required)

#### Priority 3: Command Documentation (Selected files need major additions)
- `command/cleanup.md`: 47 lines (+53 needed)
- `command/initialize.md`: 47 lines (+53 needed)
- `command/task.md`: 64 lines (+36 needed)

## Compliance Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical MCP Documentation (Week 1)
**Objective**: Bring all MCP files to 100-130 line compliance

**Actions Required**:
1. Expand tool usage sections with detailed examples (+25-35 lines per file)
2. Enhance examples sections with comprehensive workflows (+15-20 lines per file)
3. Add specific integration patterns and use cases (+5-10 lines per file)

**Expected Outcome**: All MCP files compliant with framework standards

### Phase 2: Agent Documentation Enhancement (Week 2)
**Objective**: Expand agent files to meet line count and quality standards

**Actions Required**:
1. Tool usage sections: Add specific command examples (+15-20 lines per file)
2. MCP integration sections: Detailed workflow examples (+10-15 lines per file)
3. Success metrics: Make specific and measurable (+5-10 lines per file)
4. Special handling: Reduce orchestrator.md by 41 lines

**Expected Outcome**: All agent files compliant with enhanced content quality

### Phase 3: Command Documentation Completion (Week 3)
**Objective**: Complete command documentation compliance

**Actions Required**:
1. Workflow sections: Detailed step-by-step examples (+15-25 lines per file)
2. Examples sections: Comprehensive usage scenarios (+10-15 lines per file)
3. Integration documentation: Cross-command relationships (+5-10 lines per file)

**Expected Outcome**: All command files compliant with practical examples

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance Validation (Week 4)
**Objective**: Final compliance validation and approval

**Actions Required**:
1. Line count verification for all files
2. Template structure compliance review
