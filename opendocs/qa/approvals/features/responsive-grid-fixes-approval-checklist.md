## Critical Issues Requiring Fixes

### 🚨 High Priority - Must Fix Before Production

#### 1. Card Height Consistency Issue
**Problem**: Cards within the same row have inconsistent heights due to varying content lengths.

**Current State**:
- ❌ Mobile: Heights vary between 151.25px - 174px
- ❌ Small: Heights vary between 174px - 219.5px  
- ❌ Medium: Heights vary between 196.75px - 219.5px
- ❌ Large: Heights vary between 196.75px - 219.5px

**Required Fix**:
- [ ] Implement flexbox solution to equalize card heights within each row
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing and alignment across all breakpoints
- [ ] Test with various content lengths to verify robustness

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All cards in the same row have identical heights
- [ ] Content remains properly aligned and readable
- [ ] Solution works across all breakpoints (mobile, small, medium, large)
- [ ] No negative impact on existing animations or interactions

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/components/Agents.tsx`
- `src/components/Commands.tsx`
- Potentially `src/components/ui/card.tsx`

#### 2. Accessibility Compliance Issues
**Problem**: Cards lack proper accessibility attributes for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

**Current State**:
- ❌ No `tabindex` for keyboard navigation
- ❌ Missing ARIA labels and descriptions
- ❌ No semantic role attributes
- ❌ Not keyboard accessible

**Required Fix**:
- [ ] Add `tabindex={0}` to all interactive cards
- [ ] Implement proper ARIA labels describing card content
- [ ] Add `role="button"` for interactive elements
- [ ] Implement keyboard event handlers (Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- [ ] Add focus states for keyboard navigation

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All cards are keyboard navigable
- [ ] Screen readers properly announce card content
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] Keyboard interactions work consistently across browsers
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved

#### 3. Touch Interaction Support
**Problem**: Mobile touch interactions lack proper feedback and accessibility.

**Current State**:
- ❌ No visual feedback on touch
- ❌ Missing touch event handling
- ❌ Accessibility barriers for mobile users

**Required Fix**:
- [ ] Add touch event handlers for mobile interactions
- [ ] Implement visual feedback for touch states
- [ ] Ensure touch interactions are accessible
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Touch interactions provide clear visual feedback
- [ ] Touch events work reliably on mobile devices
- [ ] No conflicts with existing hover states
- [ ] Consistent behavior across mobile platforms

### 🔍 Medium Priority - Should Fix

#### 4. Performance Optimization
**Enhancement**: Improve loading performance and animation efficiency.

**Required Tasks**:
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for cards below the fold
- [ ] Add intersection observer for animation triggers
- [ ] Optimize icon and image loading
- [ ] Reduce animation jank on lower-end devices

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Initial page load time reduced by >20%
- [ ] Smooth animations maintained on all devices
- [ ] No visual artifacts during loading
- [ ] Memory usage optimized

#### 5. Enhanced Visual Feedback
**Enhancement**: Improve user interaction feedback.

**Required Tasks**:
- [ ] Add distinct focus states for keyboard navigation
- [ ] Implement loading states for dynamic content
- [ ] Add micro-interactions for better UX
- [ ] Ensure consistent visual feedback across all interactions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Focus states are clearly visible and accessible
- [ ] Loading states provide clear user feedback
- [ ] Micro-interactions enhance rather than distract
- [ ] All feedback meets accessibility contrast requirements

- [ ] Desktop: Various resolutions (1024x768, 1920x1080, 2560x1440)

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver, TalkBack)
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation testing
- [ ] Color contrast validation
- [ ] Focus management testing

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Lighthouse performance audit (>90 score)
