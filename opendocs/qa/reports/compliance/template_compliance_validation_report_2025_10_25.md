## Agent Compliance Analysis

### Line Count Violations (>100 lines)

| Agent | Lines | Status | Priority |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| task-manager.md | 131 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| logging.md | 124 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| orchestrator.md | 115 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| context-refinement.md | 106 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| system-architect.md | 106 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |

**Compliance Rate**: 15/20 agents (75.0%) compliant

### Bullet Point Violations (Not 3-5 bullets)

| Agent | Bullet Count | Required | Status | Priority |
|-------|--------------|----------|---------|----------|
| system-architect.md | 7 bullets | 3-5 | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| docker-specialist.md | 6 bullets | 3-5 | ❌ Violation | MEDIUM |
| generator-specialist.md | 6 bullets | 3-5 | ❌ Violation | MEDIUM |
| qa-engineer.md | 6 bullets | 3-5 | ❌ Violation | MEDIUM |
| renovator.md | 6 bullets | 3-5 | ❌ Violation | MEDIUM |

**Compliance Rate**: 15/20 agents (75.0%) compliant

### Detailed Bullet Point Analysis

#### system-architect.md (7 bullets - exceeds limit)
Current focus areas cover comprehensive system architecture but exceed the 3-5 bullet requirement. Requires consolidation of related concepts.

#### Agents with 6 bullets (exceed limit)
- **docker-specialist.md**: Last bullet combines multiple concepts and should be integrated with existing points
- **generator-specialist.md**: "Real Example Generation" could be merged with "Content Generation"
- **qa-engineer.md**: "QA Documentation" could be integrated with "Quality Metrics"
- **renovator.md**: "Project Analysis" overlaps with "PR Review and Analysis"

## Command Compliance Analysis

### Line Count Violations (>60 lines)

| Command | Lines | Status | Priority |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| git.md | 80 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| task.md | 80 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| renovate.md | 78 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| cleanup.md | 77 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| implement.md | 77 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| improve.md | 77 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| load.md | 77 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| spawn.md | 77 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| troubleshoot.md | 77 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| initialize.md | 75 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| generate.md | 74 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |
| save.md | 72 lines | ❌ Violation | HIGH |

**Compliance Rate**: 1/13 commands (7.7%) compliant

### Command Structure Issues

All violating commands exceed the 60-line limit by significant margins (12-20 lines over limit). The primary issues are:

1. **Verbose Examples**: Extended example sections with multiple code blocks
2. **Detailed Workflow**: Overly descriptive workflow steps
3. **Redundant Explanations**: Repetitive content across sections

## Template Structure Compliance

### Agent Template Issues Found

| Section | Compliance Issue | Impact | Priority |
|---------|------------------|---------|----------|
| Focus Areas | 5 agents with 6-7 bullets | Template deviation | HIGH |
| Success Metrics | Generally compliant | ✅ Good | LOW |
| Tool Usage | Generally compliant | ✅ Good | LOW |
| Boundaries | Generally compliant | ✅ Good | LOW |

### Command Template Issues Found

| Section | Compliance Issue | Impact | Priority |
|---------|------------------|---------|----------|
| Line Count | 12/13 exceed 60 lines | Template deviation | CRITICAL |
| Workflow | Generally compliant | ✅ Good | LOW |
| Examples | Overly verbose | Template deviation | HIGH |
| Boundaries | Generally compliant | ✅ Good | LOW |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Agent Optimizations (HIGH Priority)

**Line Count Reduction**:
- `task-manager.md`: Reduce by 31 lines (target: 100 lines)
- `logging.md`: Reduce by 24 lines (target: 100 lines)
- `orchestrator.md`: Reduce by 15 lines (target: 100 lines)
- `context-refinement.md`: Reduce by 6 lines (target: 100 lines)
- `system-architect.md`: Reduce by 6 lines (target: 100 lines)

**Bullet Point Consolidation**:
- `system-architect.md`: Reduce from 7 to 5 bullets
- `docker-specialist.md`: Reduce from 6 to 5 bullets
- `generator-specialist.md`: Reduce from 6 to 5 bullets

## Quality Gates

### Before Optimization Completion
- [ ] All commands ≤ 60 lines
- [ ] All agents ≤ 100 lines
- [ ] All agent focus areas: 3-5 bullets
- [ ] Template structure compliance: 100%

### Validation Criteria
- Line count compliance: 100%
- Bullet point compliance: 100%
- Overall compliance score: ≥95%

---

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Ongoing Compliance Checks
- Weekly automated compliance validation
- Pre-commit template compliance verification
- Monthly comprehensive compliance reviews

### Prevention Measures
- Template compliance checklist for new agents/commands
- Automated line count validation in CI/CD
- Regular template refactoring sessions

---

## Conclusion

The current compliance score of 52.6% represents a significant degradation from the previous 87.1% and requires immediate attention. The primary issues are command line count violations (92.3% non-compliance) and agent bullet point violations (25% non-compliance).

With focused optimization efforts following the outlined plan, the framework can achieve 95%+ compliance within 2 weeks, restoring template integrity and ensuring consistent agent/command structure across the SuperCode framework.

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 command optimizations immediately, focusing on the most severe violations first.
