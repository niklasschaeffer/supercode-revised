**Migration Type**: QA Approval Storage Organization Refactoring  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 🎯 Migration Objective

Improve the organization of QA approval storage in the SuperCode project by moving QA documents from the project root to a dedicated, structured folder system.

## 📋 Migration Scope

### Before Migration
- **Problem**: QA approval documents stored in project root
- **Impact**: Poor organization, scalability issues, inconsistent with project structure
- **Files Affected**: 1 validation report in project root

### After Migration
- **Solution**: Comprehensive `opendocs/qa/` folder structure
- **Benefits**: Organized, scalable, consistent with project patterns
- **Files Created**: 15+ organized QA documents and templates

## 🏗️ New Structure Created

## 🔄 Actions Performed

### 1. Structure Creation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `opendocs/qa/` directory structure
- ✅ Established logical organization (approvals, reports, templates, standards)
- ✅ Added appropriate `.gitkeep` files for empty directories
- ✅ Created detailed README with organization guidelines

### 2. Content Migration
- ✅ Moved `mobile_optimization_agent_validation_report.md` to `opendocs/qa/approvals/agents/`
- ✅ Renamed to follow new naming convention: `mobile-optimization-agent-validation-report.md`
- ✅ Removed original file from project root
- ✅ Verified no broken references to old location

### 3. Template Creation
- ✅ Created `validation-report.template.md` for standardized validation reports
- ✅ Created `approval-checklist.template.md` for systematic approval processes
- ✅ Established template patterns for future QA documents

### 4. Standards Documentation
- ✅ Created `approval-criteria.md` with comprehensive approval standards
- ✅ Created `testing-standards.md` with testing procedures and requirements
- ✅ Created `quality-metrics.md` with measurable quality indicators

### 5. Agent Updates
