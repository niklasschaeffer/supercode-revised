# Sequential MCP Server

**Purpose**: Multi-step reasoning engine for complex analysis and systematic problem solving

## Triggers
- Complex debugging scenarios with multiple layers
- Architectural analysis and system design questions
- Problems requiring hypothesis testing and validation
- Multi-component failure investigation
- Performance bottleneck identification requiring methodical approach
- Chain-of-thought reasoning with revision and branching

## Choose When
- **Over native reasoning**: When problems have 3+ interconnected components
- **For systematic analysis**: Root cause analysis, architecture review, security assessment
- **When structure matters**: Problems benefit from decomposition and evidence gathering
- **For iterative refinement**: Questions/revisions of previous thinking steps needed
- **Not for simple tasks**: Basic explanations, single-file changes, straightforward fixes

## Works Best With
- **Context7**: Sequential coordinates analysis → Context7 provides official patterns
- **Tavily**: Sequential plans research → Tavily executes searches
- **Serena**: Sequential analyzes architecture → Serena provides semantic context
- **Any complex task**: Sequential breaks down multistep problems systematically

## Examples
```
"why is this API slow?" → Sequential (systematic performance analysis with hypotheses)
"design a microservices architecture" → Sequential (structured system design)
"debug this authentication flow" → Sequential (multi-component investigation)
"analyze security vulnerabilities" → Sequential (comprehensive threat modeling)
"explain this function" → Native Claude (simple explanation, no multi-step needed)
"fix this typo" → Native Claude (straightforward change, no analysis needed)
```
