# In-Memoria MCP Server

**Purpose**: Persistent memory and pattern learning for AI coding assistants that solves session amnesia

## Triggers
- AI assistant session amnesia and lack of codebase memory
- Need for persistent coding pattern recognition across sessions
- Architectural decision tracking and style consistency enforcement
- Automatic codebase learning with 17 MCP tools for analysis
- Multi-language pattern intelligence (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, C#, Svelte, Vue, SQL)
- Team onboarding with pre-learned codebase intelligence sharing

## Tool Usage

### Primary Tools
- `in-memoria_learn_codebase_intelligence`: Comprehensive codebase analysis and pattern learning
- `in-memoria_get_developer_profile`: Retrieve learned coding preferences and style patterns
- `in-memoria_predict_coding_approach`: Predict solutions based on learned developer patterns
- `in-memoria_get_pattern_recommendations`: Get intelligent pattern suggestions for coding context
- `in-memoria_contribute_insights`: Add new insights back to the knowledge base

### Secondary Tools
- `in-memoria_analyze_codebase`: Perform semantic analysis of code structure and patterns
- `in-memoria_get_semantic_insights`: Retrieve insights about code concepts and relationships
- `in-memoria_generate_documentation`: Create intelligent documentation from learned patterns
- `in-memoria_get_project_structure`: Analyze and understand project architecture
- `in-memoria_auto_learn_if_needed`: Automatic learning when intelligence data is missing

## Accessibility
- Direct file system access for comprehensive codebase analysis
- Pattern recognition engine for understanding coding styles and conventions
- Multi-language parsing support for 10+ programming languages
- Persistent database storage for maintaining learned patterns across sessions
- Team collaboration features for sharing learned intelligence

## Choose When
- **Over basic memory tools**: When you need pattern prediction, not just fact storage
- **For persistent intelligence**: AI remembers your coding style, architecture decisions across sessions
- **For pattern learning**: Statistical analysis of naming conventions, architectural choices, code structure
- **Over manual rules**: Dynamic learning from actual code instead of static, manually defined rules
- **Not for one-time analysis**: Use Serena for symbol operations, In-Memoria for persistent learning

## Works Best With
- **Serena**: Serena provides symbol operations → In-Memoria learns persistent patterns from changes
- **Sequential**: Sequential analyzes architecture → In-Memoria remembers decisions for future sessions
- **Any AI assistant**: In-Memoria enhances Claude, Copilot, Cursor with persistent codebase memory

## Examples
```
"learn my codebase patterns" → In-Memoria (analyzes code, builds statistical pattern models)
"what coding style do I prefer?" → In-Memoria (retrieves developer profile with learned preferences)
"suggest code matching my patterns" → In-Memoria (pattern recommendations based on your style)
"how would I solve this problem?" → In-Memoria (predicts approach based on learned patterns)
"share team coding patterns" → In-Memoria (exports .in-memoria.db for team consistency)
"explain this function" → Native Claude (one-time question, no persistent learning needed)
```
