# In-Memoria MCP Server

**Purpose**: Persistent memory and pattern learning for AI coding assistants that solves session amnesia

## Triggers
- AI assistant session amnesia and lack of codebase memory
- Need for persistent coding pattern recognition across sessions
- Architectural decision tracking and style consistency enforcement
- Automatic codebase learning with 17 MCP tools for analysis
- Multi-language pattern intelligence (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, C#, Svelte, Vue, SQL)
- Team onboarding with pre-learned codebase intelligence sharing

## Choose When
- **Over basic memory tools**: When you need pattern prediction, not just fact storage
- **For persistent intelligence**: AI remembers your coding style, architecture decisions across sessions
- **For pattern learning**: Statistical analysis of naming conventions, architectural choices, code structure
- **Over manual rules**: Dynamic learning from actual code instead of static, manually-defined rules
- **Not for one-time analysis**: Use Serena for symbol operations, In-Memoria for persistent learning

## Works Best With
- **Serena**: Serena provides symbol operations → In-Memoria learns persistent patterns from changes
- **Sequential**: Sequential analyzes architecture → In-Memoria remembers decisions for future sessions
- **Any AI assistant**: In-Memoria enhances Claude, Copilot, Cursor with persistent codebase memory

## Examples
```
"learn my codebase patterns" → In-Memoria (analyzes code, builds statistical pattern models)
"what coding style do I prefer?" → In-Memoria (retrieves developer profile with learned preferences)
"suggest code matching my patterns" → In-Memoria (pattern recommendations based on your style)
"how would I solve this problem?" → In-Memoria (predicts approach based on learned patterns)
"share team coding patterns" → In-Memoria (exports .in-memoria.db for team consistency)
"explain this function" → Native Claude (one-time question, no persistent learning needed)
```
