### Proposed Consolidated Structure (13 agents)

**Primary Agents (1)**
1. orchestrator.md - Primary coordination and orchestration

**Consolidated Agents (3)**
2. context-management.md - **NEW**: Consolidates context-refinement + logging + task-manager + root-cause-analyst
3. infrastructure.md - **NEW**: Consolidates devops-engineer + docker-specialist  
4. support-operations.md - **NEW**: Consolidates renovator + generator-specialist

**Domain Specialists (7)**
5. backend-engineer.md - Backend development specialist
6. frontend-engineer.md - Frontend development specialist
7. database-engineer.md - Database design and optimization
8. security-engineer.md - Security implementation and auditing
9. refactoring-expert.md - Code quality improvement and technical debt reduction
10. qa-engineer.md - Testing and validation specialist
11. mobile-optimization.md - Mobile-specific optimization

**Research & Analysis (2)**
12. deep-research-specialist.md - Complex research and multi-source analysis
13. git-specialist.md - Git workflows and forge integration

### Consolidation Details

#### 1. Context-Management Agent (4→1 consolidation)
**Merged Functions:**
- Context refinement and optimization for agent consumption
- Session state preservation to Serena memories and In-Memoria patterns
- Task decomposition and hierarchical management with cross-session persistence
- Root cause analysis and systematic debugging workflows

**Benefits:**
- Unified context lifecycle management
- Seamless integration between refinement, preservation, and analysis
- Reduced context switching between related functions
- 75% reduction in context management agents

#### 2. Infrastructure Agent (2→1 consolidation)
**Merged Functions:**
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation, Pulumi)
- CI/CD pipeline setup and optimization (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes, docker-compose)
- Monitoring, logging, and observability systems
- Deployment strategies with rollback capabilities

**Benefits:**
- Complete infrastructure lifecycle management
- Unified deployment and monitoring approach
- Reduced coordination overhead between infrastructure components
- 50% reduction in infrastructure agents

#### 3. Support-Operations Agent (2→1 consolidation)
**Merged Functions:**
- Project renovation and dependency management with Renovate-Bot expertise
- Template-compliant generation of agents, commands, and MCP documentation
- Risk assessment and safety-first decision making
- Framework component generation and validation

**Benefits:**
- Unified project maintenance and generation capabilities
- Integrated risk assessment across renovation and generation
- Streamlined project health management
- 50% reduction in support agents

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

#### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain existing agent interfaces during transition
- Preserve all current functionality within consolidated agents
- Gradual migration with testing at each step
- Rollback capability for each consolidation

#### Migration Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Create new consolidated agents with full functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Test consolidated agents against existing workflows
3. **Phase 3**: Update orchestrator to use consolidated agents
4. **Phase 4**: Archive deprecated agents with migration documentation

#### Validation Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved
- No regression in agent performance
- Improved efficiency through reduced coordination overhead
- Clear documentation of consolidated capabilities

### Expected Benefits

#### Quantitative Improvements
- **Agent Count Reduction**: 19→13 agents (32% reduction)
- **Context Management**: 4→1 agent (75% reduction)
- **Infrastructure**: 2→1 agent (50% reduction)
- **Support Operations**: 2→1 agent (50% reduction)

#### Qualitative Improvements
- Reduced coordination overhead between related functions
- Unified workflows for consolidated domains
- Simplified agent management and maintenance
- Improved efficiency through integrated capabilities
- Clearer specialization boundaries

### Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Create Consolidated Agents
- Implement context-management.md with merged functionality
- Implement infrastructure.md with merged functionality  
- Implement support-operations.md with merged functionality

#### Step 2: Testing and Validation
- Test each consolidated agent against original agent workflows
- Validate functionality preservation
- Performance benchmarking

#### Step 3: Integration
- Update orchestrator.md to use consolidated agents
- Update AGENTS.md with new structure
- Create migration documentation

#### Step 4: Archive and Documentation
- Archive deprecated agents with clear migration paths
- Update all relevant documentation
- Create rollback procedures

### Success Metrics

#### Consolidation Success
- 100% functionality preservation from original agents
- >30% reduction in agent coordination overhead
- >25% improvement in workflow efficiency
- Zero regression in agent performance

#### Migration Success
- Smooth transition with minimal disruption
- Clear documentation of changes
- Successful rollback capability if needed
- User adoption and satisfaction
