# SuperCode Framework - Project Brief

## Overview
SuperCode is an advanced agent-based development framework designed to streamline software development through intelligent automation and specialized AI agents.

## Core Architecture

### Agent System
- **Primary Agent**: Orchestrator (central coordination)
- **Engineering Specialists**: Backend, Frontend, QA, Security, DevOps, Database, Docker
- **Architecture & Analysis**: System Architect, Refactoring Expert, Root Cause Analyst, Deep Research
- **Workflow & Management**: Renovator, Git Specialist, Task Manager, Mobile Optimization
- **Specialized Tools**: Context Refinement, Generator Specialist, Logging

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0 + TypeScript 5.2.2 + Vite 5.0.8
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.3.6 + Radix UI components
- **Development**: ESLint, PostCSS, Rollup visualizer
- **Integration**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers

### MCP Integration
11 integrated MCP servers providing comprehensive tool coverage:
- Chrome DevTools, Context7, Forgejo, In-Memoria, Mimik
- Playwright, Prompt Kit, Shadcn, Sequential, Tavily, Desktop Commander

### Command System
15+ functional commands with standardized templates:
- Core: /initialize, /load, /save, /spawn, /task
- Development: /implement, /improve, /build, /generate
- Management: /cleanup, /git, /renovate, /troubleshoot

## Development Workflow
1. Template-based development with 100% compliance
2. Agent specialization for domain-specific tasks
3. MCP server utilization for extended capabilities
4. Quality assurance validation and testing
5. Continuous integration and deployment

## Key Features
- **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Automatic breakdown of complex tasks
- **Context Caching**: Efficient reuse of gathered information
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents working in parallel
- **Framework Integration**: Seamless MCP server connectivity
- **Template Standardization**: Consistent agent and command structure

## Current Status
- Active development with ongoing MCP integration
- Template standardization complete
- QA validation system operational
- Landing page component architecture established
