## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Reference-Based Documentation
- **"See X" Patterns**: Reference detailed content instead of repeating
- **Domain-Specific Guidance**: Document once by domain, reference everywhere
- **Pattern Libraries**: Common patterns documented centrally
- **Workflow Standards**: Unified command workflows with reference patterns

### Consolidation Strategies
1. **Eliminated Redundant References**: Centralized reference patterns
2. **Standardized Tool Usage**: Domain-based tool documentation
3. **Unified Workflows**: Common command patterns documented once
4. **Centralized Validation**: Single source for quality standards

### Quality Assurance
- **Structure Validation**: Frontmatter, sections, reference integrity
- **Content Validation**: No duplication, pattern compliance, domain specificity
- **Integration Validation**: File placement, registry updates, template usage
