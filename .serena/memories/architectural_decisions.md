# Architectural Decisions

## Dual MCP Integration (2025-10-21)

### Decision: Implement Dual MCP Architecture
**Rationale**: Enhance SuperCode framework with both explicit persistence (Serena) and implicit learning (In-Memoria)

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Complexity**: Increased system complexity vs. enhanced capabilities
- **Maintenance**: Two MCP systems vs. single point of failure
- **Learning Curve**: Dual integration vs. simplified workflow

**Chosen Approach**: Dual MCP integration for complementary strengths

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Serena MCP**: Human-readable memories for explicit session state
2. **In-Memoria MCP**: AI-driven pattern discovery for implicit learning
3. **Integration Points**: Commands (load/save) and Agents (logging)
4. **Workflow**: Load → Work → Save cycle with both MCPs

### Benefits Realized
- Cross-session continuity through persistent memories
- Intelligent framework evolution through pattern learning
- Human + AI memory systems for comprehensive knowledge management
- Self-improving capabilities over time

## Previous Decisions (Preserved)

### Agent Architecture (2025-10-21)
- Orchestration agent as primary coordinator
- Specialized sub-agents for domain expertise
- Clear tool boundaries and responsibilities

### Command System (2025-10-21)
- YAML frontmatter for structured metadata
- Consistent behavior patterns across commands
- Integration with MCP servers for persistence

### Template System (2025-10-21)
- Standardized templates for agents and commands
- MCP server templates for integration
- Consistent structure for maintainability
