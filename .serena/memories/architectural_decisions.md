# Architectural Decisions

## MCP Documentation Standardization (2025-10-22)

### Decision: Implement Template-Driven Documentation Standardization
**Rationale**: Ensure consistency, maintainability, and developer experience across all MCP server documentation

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Customization vs. Consistency**: Individual file customization vs. unified structure
- **Development Speed**: Quick updates vs. systematic template compliance
- **Content Depth**: Variable depth vs. standardized coverage

**Chosen Approach**: Template-first standardization with consistent structure and depth

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Template Authority**: Use `templates/MCP_Server.template.md` as single source of truth
2. **Section Hierarchy**: Purpose → Triggers → Tool Usage → Accessibility → Choose When → Works Best With → Examples
3. **Content Standardization**: 5 bullet points per subsection for balanced coverage
4. **Technical Accuracy**: Use actual MCP function names instead of generic descriptions
5. **Dual Section Addition**: Add both "Tool Usage" and "Accessibility" sections to all files

### Benefits Realized
- 100% template compliance across 11 MCP documentation files
- Improved developer experience with actionable, copy-pasteable examples
- Reduced cognitive load through predictable documentation structure
- Enhanced maintainability through template-driven approach
- Comprehensive coverage including accessibility considerations
- Scalable documentation system for future MCP additions

## Dual MCP Integration (2025-10-21)

### Decision: Implement Dual MCP Architecture
**Rationale**: Enhance SuperCode framework with both explicit persistence (Serena) and implicit learning (In-Memoria)

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Complexity**: Increased system complexity vs. enhanced capabilities
- **Maintenance**: Two MCP systems vs. single point of failure
- **Learning Curve**: Dual integration vs. simplified workflow

**Chosen Approach**: Dual MCP integration for complementary strengths

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Serena MCP**: Human-readable memories for explicit session state
2. **In-Memoria MCP**: AI-driven pattern discovery for implicit learning
3. **Integration Points**: Commands (load/save) and Agents (logging)
4. **Workflow**: Load → Work → Save cycle with both MCPs

### Benefits Realized
- Cross-session continuity through persistent memories
- Intelligent framework evolution through pattern learning
- Human + AI memory systems for comprehensive knowledge management
- Self-improving capabilities over time

## QA Documentation Organization (2025-10-22)

### Decision: Implement Structured QA Documentation System
**Rationale**: Improve organization and scalability of QA approval storage by moving from project root to dedicated `opendocs/qa/` structure

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Complexity**: Initial setup complexity vs. long-term maintainability
- **Migration Effort**: One-time migration cost vs. ongoing organizational benefits
- **Learning Curve**: New structure adoption vs. improved discoverability

**Chosen Approach**: Comprehensive `opendocs/qa/` folder structure with templates and standards

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Structure Creation**: Organized folders (approvals/, reports/, standards/, templates/)
2. **Content Migration**: Move existing QA documents from project root to appropriate locations
3. **Template Development**: Standardized templates for validation reports and checklists
4. **Standards Documentation**: Comprehensive QA criteria and metrics
5. **Reference Integrity**: Maintain all cross-references during migration
6. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing of new structure functionality

### Benefits Realized
- Professional organization following project patterns
- Scalable structure supporting framework growth
- Standardized QA processes and documentation
- Clear audit trail for approvals and validations
- Template-driven consistency for future QA documents
- Reserved `opendocs/` folder for organized documentation
- Enterprise-grade QA approval storage system

## Agent Role Specialization (2025-10-22)

### Decision: Transform Context-Gathering to Context-Refinement with Enhanced Orchestration
**Rationale**: Eliminate role overlap and improve workflow efficiency through clear separation of concerns

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Role Complexity**: Specialized roles vs. generalist approach
- **Coordination Overhead**: Multi-agent workflow vs. single-agent simplicity
- **Migration Risk**: Architectural changes vs. maintaining status quo

**Chosen Approach**: Context-gathering → Context-refinement transformation with orchestration enhancement

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Role Transformation**: Convert context-gathering agent to context-refinement specialist
2. **Orchestration Enhancement**: Empower orchestration agent with primary context gathering
3. **Workflow Separation**: Clear distinction between gathering (orchestration) and refinement (specialized)
4. **Integration Updates**: Update all references and integration points
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing functionality during transformation

### Benefits Realized
- Clear separation of concerns between gathering and refinement
- Improved agent coordination and workflow efficiency
- Reduced redundancy in context management
- Enhanced specialization for better context processing
- Scalable architecture for future agent evolution
- Maintained backward compatibility during transformation

## QA Documentation Organization

### Decision: Implement Structured QA Documentation System
**Rationale**: Improve organization and scalability of QA approval storage by moving from project root to dedicated `docs/qa/` structure

**Trade-offs Considered**:
- **Complexity**: Initial setup complexity vs. long-term maintainability
- **Migration Effort**: One-time migration cost vs. ongoing organizational benefits
- **Learning Curve**: New structure adoption vs. improved discoverability

**Chosen Approach**: Comprehensive `docs/qa/` folder structure with templates and standards

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Structure Creation**: Organized folders (approvals/, reports/, templates/, standards/)
2. **Content Migration**: Move existing QA documents to appropriate locations
3. **Template Development**: Standardized templates for validation reports and checklists
4. **Standards Documentation**: Comprehensive QA criteria and metrics
5. **Agent Integration**: Update qa-engineer agent to use new structure

### Benefits Realized
- Professional organization following project patterns
- Scalable structure supporting framework growth
- Standardized QA processes and documentation
- Clear audit trail for approvals and validations
- Template-driven consistency for future QA documents
