# Session: Save Command Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Focus**: Implementation of /save command for session persistence

## Command Created

### save.md (100 lines - at limit)
- **Purpose**: Persist session context to Serena memories for cross-session continuity
- **Complement to**: load.md (load=READ operations, save=WRITE operations)
- **Integration**: Serena MCP write_memory for durable persistence
- **Use Cases**: Session end, checkpoints, decision capture, pattern documentation

## Architecture

### Sequential MCP Analysis (12 thoughts)
1. Load.md structure analysis: YAML → Behavior → Return Format → Workflow → Examples
2. Save mirrors load but focuses on persistence (write vs read operations)
3. Captured content: Session summary, architectural decisions, patterns, next steps
4. Triggers: Session end, 30-min checkpoints, before risky ops, after milestones
5. In-Memoria: Auto-learning passive, no explicit save needed (focused on Serena)
6. Session triggers: "done", "finished", explicit /save, checkpoint intervals
7. Return format: Saved memories, session summary, checkpoint status, next session hints
8. Tool requirements: Serena write_memory (primary), list_memories, read_memory
9. Line budget: ~90 lines estimated, actual 100 lines (at limit)
10. Integration: Standalone command (not agent-specific), session lifecycle management
11. Load vs Save differentiation: Load=retrieve, Save=persist, perfect complements
12. Final structure: Session Analysis → Persistence → Validation workflow

### Command Structure
**YAML Frontmatter**:
- name: save
- description: Persist session context to Serena memories
- agents: general (not agent-specific)

**Sections**:
1. Title & Description: Save session work and create resumable checkpoints
2. Context: Current directory (!`pwd`)
3. Behavior: Serena integration with write_memory operations
4. Captured Content: Session summary, decisions, patterns, next steps
5. Return Format: Memories created, session summary, checkpoint status
6. Workflow: Session Analysis → Persistence → Validation (3 phases)
7. Tool Requirements: Serena write_memory, list_memories, read_memory
8. Examples: Basic save, checkpoint, decision capture, pattern documentation
9. Integration: Pairs with /load for session lifecycle

### Session Lifecycle Pattern
```
/load (session start)
  ↓
Work (with periodic /save checkpoints)
  ↓
/save (session end with full summary)
```

## Features

### Captured Content Types
1. **Session Summary**: Work accomplished, files modified, features implemented
2. **Architectural Decisions**: Design choices, trade-offs, rationale
3. **Pattern Discovery**: Coding patterns, conventions discovered during work
4. **Next Session Context**: Incomplete work, blockers, continuation points

### Command Variants
- `/save` - Basic session summary
- `/save --checkpoint` - Detailed checkpoint with full state
- `/save --decision "..."` - Capture specific architectural decision
- `/save --patterns` - Document discovered coding patterns

### Persistence Strategy
- **Naming**: session_YYYY_MM_DD_topic for discoverability
- **Validation**: Confirm all memories written, verify completeness
- **Resumption**: Provide clear next-session context and /load instructions

## Integration with Framework

### AGENTS.md Update
Added new "Commands" section between "Sub Agents" and "MCP Servers":
```
# Commands
[@command/load.md](./command/load.md)
[@command/save.md](./command/save.md)
```

### Serena MCP Operations
- **write_memory**: Primary operation for session persistence
- **list_memories**: Validation and avoiding duplication
- **read_memory**: Check existing content before updates

### Complementarity with load.md
- **load.md** (95 lines): READ operations - retrieve context
- **save.md** (100 lines): WRITE operations - persist context
- Together: Complete session lifecycle management

## Files Modified

**Created** (1 file):
- command/save.md (100 lines - at 100-line limit)

**Updated** (1 file):
- AGENTS.md: Added Commands section with load.md and save.md

## Quality Validation

✅ save.md exactly 100 lines (at limit, acceptable)
✅ Mirrors load.md structure and organization
✅ Focuses on WRITE operations (complementary to load's READ)
✅ Comprehensive examples covering 4 use cases
✅ Clear integration with session lifecycle
✅ AGENTS.md updated with Commands section
✅ Pairs perfectly with load.md for complete session management

## Design Principles Applied

1. **Complementarity**: Perfect mirror of load.md (read vs write)
2. **Session Lifecycle**: Enable cross-session continuity
3. **Structured Persistence**: Organized memory naming and content
4. **Validation**: Confirm successful persistence
5. **Resumability**: Provide clear next-session context
