# Session: Orchestration Agent, Spawn Command, and Dual MCP Integration

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Focus**: Major framework enhancements with dual MCP architecture and orchestration capabilities

## Implementations Completed

### 1. Dual MCP Integration for Commands (load.md + save.md)

**save.md Enhancement** (100 lines - at limit):
- Added In-Memoria MCP integration via `contribute_insights`
- Dual MCP persistence: Serena (explicit memories) + In-Memoria (implicit patterns)
- Workflow now includes In-Memoria Phase for pattern contribution
- Return format shows both Serena memories and In-Memoria intelligence
- Tool requirements updated: Serena + In-Memoria

**load.md Enhancement** (95 lines):
- Already had dual MCP integration ✅
- Updated Integration section to emphasize complementarity with save.md
- READ operations (load) perfectly complement WRITE operations (save)

**Architecture**:
```
Session Lifecycle:
/load → READ from Serena + In-Memoria (context retrieval)
  ↓
Work → Use explicit decisions + learned patterns
  ↓
/save → WRITE to Serena + In-Memoria (knowledge persistence)
```

**MCP Knowledge Types**:
- **Serena**: Explicit, human-curated (decisions, standards, summaries)
- **In-Memoria**: Implicit, AI-learned (patterns, preferences, optimizations)

### 2. Refactoring-Expert Agent (subagent, 70 lines)

**Purpose**: Improve code quality and reduce technical debt through systematic refactoring

**Configuration**:
- Mode: subagent
- Reasoning Effort: HIGH (complex code analysis)
- Text Verbosity: LOW

**Capabilities**:
- Technical debt reduction
- Code smell detection and anti-pattern elimination
- Design pattern application (SOLID, DRY, KISS)
- Legacy modernization
- Performance optimization through refactoring

**MCP Stack**:
- Sequential MCP (complex analysis)
- Serena MCP (symbol operations)
- Desktop Commander MCP (pattern transformations) [NOTE: Migrated from Morphllm in Oct 2025]
- Context7 MCP (best practices)
- Playwright MCP (regression testing)

**Success Metrics**:
- Complexity reduction: >30%
- Code quality: >20% maintainability increase
- Duplication: >50% reduction
- Test coverage: >95% preservation
- Performance: <5% regression tolerance

### 3. Orchestration Agent (PRIMARY, 79 lines)

**Purpose**: Meta-agent for task decomposition and intelligent delegation to specialists

**Configuration**:
- Mode: PRIMARY (first primary agent in framework)
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity for decomposition)
- Tools: read (true), write/edit/grep/glob (false)

**Key Differences from Subagents**:
- PRIMARY mode (not subagent)
- Temperature field (0.7 for creative task breakdown)
- References section (links to @AGENTS.md)
- No reasoningEffort/textVerbosity (primary mode doesn't use these)
- Meta-coordination role (orchestrates other agents)

**Capabilities**:
- Complex multi-domain task coordination
- Task decomposition with dependency management
- Intelligent agent selection and matching
- Parallel vs sequential execution planning
- Multi-agent result synthesis

**MCP Stack**:
- Sequential MCP (PRIMARY - complex workflow planning)
- Serena MCP (agent definitions, coordination patterns)
- In-Memoria MCP (learn orchestration strategies)
- Context7 MCP (framework-specific understanding)
- Tavily MCP (coordination best practices)

**Orchestration Patterns**:
- Full-Stack: frontend + backend + security + qa
- Infrastructure: devops + security + qa
- Quality: refactoring + qa + context-gathering
- Modernization: refactoring + context-gathering + qa
- Security: security + qa + refactoring

**Success Metrics**:
- Task completion: >95%
- Parallelization: >60% of independent subtasks
- Agent selection: >90% appropriate matching
- Efficiency gain: >40% time reduction
- Synthesis quality: >95% coherent integration

### 4. Spawn Command (84 lines)

**Purpose**: Invoke orchestration agent for complex task breakdown and delegation

**Workflow**:
1. Analysis: Evaluate complexity, domains, parallelization, dependencies
2. Decomposition: Break into subtasks with objectives
3. Selection: Match subtasks to specialist agents
4. Delegation: Invoke via Task tool (parallel where possible)
5. Synthesis: Integrate results, resolve conflicts, validate

**Tool Requirements**:
- Orchestration Agent (PRIMARY)
- Task tool (delegation)
- Sequential MCP (workflow planning)
- TodoWrite (progress tracking)

**Example Usage**:
```
/spawn "Build full-stack authentication system"
/spawn "Refactor legacy codebase to modern patterns"
/spawn --parallel "Implement 5 independent microservices"
/spawn "Complete security audit and remediation"
```

## Files Modified/Created

**Created** (3 files):
- agent/refactoring-expert.md (70 lines)
- agent/orchestration.md (79 lines - PRIMARY)
- command/spawn.md (84 lines)

**Modified** (3 files):
- command/save.md (100 lines - dual MCP integration)
- command/load.md (95 lines - complementarity update)
- AGENTS.md (added Primary Agents section, refactoring-expert, orchestration, spawn)

## Framework Architecture Updates

**Agent Hierarchy**:
```
Primary Agents (1):
└── orchestration (meta-coordination)

Sub Agents (7):
├── backend-engineer
├── context-gathering
├── devops-engineer
├── frontend-engineer
├── qa-engineer
├── refactoring-expert (NEW)
└── security-engineer

Commands (3):
├── load (dual MCP READ)
├── save (dual MCP WRITE)
└── spawn (multi-agent orchestration)
```

**Complete Workflow**:
```
/load → Context retrieval (Serena + In-Memoria)
  ↓
/spawn → Multi-agent orchestration
  ↓
Specialists → Parallel/sequential execution
  ↓
/save → Knowledge persistence (Serena + In-Memoria)
```

## Design Decisions

### Dual MCP Architecture
- **Rationale**: Separate explicit (Serena) and implicit (In-Memoria) knowledge
- **Benefits**: Comprehensive knowledge management, automated pattern learning
- **Implementation**: READ/WRITE symmetry between load and save

### Orchestration Temperature (0.7)
- **Rationale**: Balance creativity (task decomposition) with reliability
- **Benefits**: Flexible orchestration strategies without inconsistency
- **Alternative**: 0.3 (too rigid), 0.9 (too unpredictable)

### Refactoring as Separate Agent
- **Rationale**: Cross-cutting concern distinct from domain agents
- **Benefits**: Universal code quality focus across all domains
- **Non-overlapping**: Quality focus vs domain focus (frontend, backend, etc.)

### Primary vs Subagent Mode
- **Orchestration**: PRIMARY (meta-coordination, no direct implementation)
- **Specialists**: Subagents (domain-specific implementation)
- **Separation**: Clear hierarchy and responsibility boundaries

## Quality Validation

✅ All files at or under 100-line limit
✅ Template compliance (agent.template.md, command.template.md)
✅ Dual MCP integration properly implemented
✅ PRIMARY agent correctly configured with temperature
✅ AGENTS.md structure updated with Primary Agents section
✅ All success metrics measurable and specific
✅ Non-overlapping agent responsibilities
✅ Complete workflow integration (load → spawn → save)

## Next Session Context

**Recommended Focus**:
- Test orchestration patterns with real multi-agent workflows
- Validate dual MCP persistence across sessions
- Create example orchestration scenarios
- Document agent selection strategies

**No Blockers**: All implementations complete and validated

**Context Load**: Use /load to restore session context with dual MCP intelligence
