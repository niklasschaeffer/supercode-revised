# Session: Template Updates and New Agent Implementations

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Duration**: Extended implementation session
**Focus**: Template compliance updates + 3 new agents/commands created

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Template Compliance - All Agents Updated (10 agents)

**Agent Template Enhancement**:
- Expanded tools frontmatter from 5-6 tools to 11 comprehensive tools
- New tools added: bash, list, task, WebFetch, TodoWrite, TodoRead
- All agents updated with appropriate true/false values per agent needs

**Updated Agents**:
1. orchestration (PRIMARY) - Added: task, TodoWrite (delegation + tracking)
2. context-gathering - Added: list, TodoWrite (directory ops + tracking)
3. frontend-engineer - Added: TodoWrite (multi-component tracking)
4. backend-engineer - Added: TodoWrite (complex feature tracking)
5. devops-engineer - Added: bash, TodoWrite (deployment commands + tracking)
6. security-engineer - Added: TodoWrite (security task tracking)
7. qa-engineer - Added: TodoWrite (test implementation tracking)
8. refactoring-expert - Added: TodoWrite (refactoring operation tracking)

**Key Pattern**: All agents now have TodoWrite capability for progress tracking

### 2. Template Compliance - All Commands Updated (6 commands)

**Command Template Enhancement**:
- Added References section linking to FLAGS.md
- Added General Context section with 4 fields:
  - Arguments: $ARGUMENTS
  - Git Branch: !git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
  - Git Status: !git status --short | grep '^ M'
  - Current Directory: !pwd

**Updated Commands**:
1. load.md - Session start context retrieval
2. save.md - Session end state preservation
3. spawn.md - Multi-agent orchestration
4. troubleshoot.md - Error diagnosis (NEW, updated during creation)
5. improve.md - Code quality enhancement (NEW, updated during creation)
6. generate.md - Component generation (NEW, updated during creation)

**Consistency Achievement**: All commands now follow exact template structure

### 3. New Agent: Logging (Session State Preservation)

**File**: agent/logging.md (71 lines)
**Purpose**: Preserve session state and learnings to Serena + In-Memoria

**Configuration**:
- Mode: subagent
- Reasoning: medium (session analysis)
- Verbosity: low (structured output)
- Tools: read, grep, glob, list, TodoWrite, TodoRead

**MCP Integration**:
- Serena MCP: write_memory for explicit session summaries
- In-Memoria MCP: contribute_insights for pattern learning
- Sequential MCP: Systematic session transcript analysis

**Key Innovation**: Dual MCP integration specialist for WRITE operations (complements context-gathering's READ operations)

**Command Integration**: save.md updated to invoke logging agent

### 4. New Agent: Root-Cause-Analyst (Systematic Debugging)

**File**: agent/root-cause-analyst.md (76 lines)
**Purpose**: Diagnose errors through hypothesis-driven investigation

**Configuration**:
- Mode: subagent
- Reasoning: high (complex investigation)
- Verbosity: low (concise diagnostics)
- Tools: bash, read, grep, glob, list, TodoWrite, TodoRead

**MCP Integration**:
- Sequential MCP (PRIMARY): Hypothesis testing methodology
- Serena MCP: Codebase navigation and dependency tracking
- Playwright MCP: Browser/UI error reproduction
- Chrome DevTools MCP: Performance profiling and debugging
- Tavily MCP: Research known error patterns

**Key Innovation**: Diagnoses but doesn't fix (WILL NOT modify code)

**Command Created**: troubleshoot.md (75 lines) for /troubleshoot invocation

**Success Metrics**:
- Root cause accuracy: >90%
- Investigation efficiency: <15 min typical, <45 min complex
- Hypothesis quality: >80% relevant
- Reproduction rate: >85%
- Solution validation: >95% fixes address root cause

### 5. New Command: /improve (Code Quality Enhancement)

**File**: command/improve.md (84 lines)
**Purpose**: Systematic code improvement without breaking functionality

**Agent**: refactoring-expert (existing agent, perfect match)

**Workflow**:
1. Code Analysis: Identify smells, complexity, duplication
2. Improvement Planning: Prioritize by impact, plan incremental steps
3. Systematic Refactoring: Apply SOLID, DRY, KISS with validation
4. Validation & Documentation: Test after each change, update docs

**Key Safety Features**:
- Incremental validated changes
- Test-driven refactoring approach
- Behavior preservation mandatory
- Rollback plan for each change

**Usage Examples**:
- /improve src/api/ (comprehensive improvement)
- /improve --focus complexity helpers.js (targeted complexity reduction)
- /improve --safe auth-service (extra validation, smaller steps)
- /improve --performance data-processing (performance optimization)

### 6. New Agent: Generator-Specialist (Framework Expansion)

**File**: agent/generator-specialist.md (75 lines)
**Purpose**: Generate template-compliant agents, commands, MCP docs

**Configuration**:
- Mode: subagent
- Reasoning: medium (template analysis + requirement mapping)
- Verbosity: low (structured validation output)
- Tools: write, read, grep, glob, list, TodoWrite

**MCP Integration**:
- Sequential MCP (PRIMARY): Requirements analysis, template mapping, validation
- Serena MCP: Read templates, check for duplicates
- In-Memoria MCP: Learn generation patterns and preferences
- Context7 MCP: MCP server documentation patterns
- Tavily MCP: Research MCP capabilities and best practices

**Key Innovation**: Meta-agent that creates other framework components

**Command Created**: generate.md (84 lines) for /generate invocation

**Capabilities**:
- Generate agents from agent.template.md
- Generate commands from command.template.md
- Generate MCP docs from MCP_Server.template.md
- Automatic AGENTS.md registration
- Structure validation and compliance checking

**Success Metrics**:
- Template compliance: 100%
- Generation speed: <30s agent, <20s command, <40s MCP doc
- Validation accuracy: >95% pass first attempt
- Integration success: 100% AGENTS.md registration
- Completeness: >98% meaningful content (no placeholders)

## Framework State After Session

**Agent Count**: 10 sub-agents + 1 primary agent
**Command Count**: 6 commands (all with complete template compliance)
**New Agents**: 3 (logging, root-cause-analyst, generator-specialist)
**New Commands**: 3 (improve, troubleshoot, generate)
**Template Updates**: 100% compliance across all agents and commands

## Key Patterns Discovered

### 1. Tool Frontmatter Pattern
All agents should declare all 11 tools with explicit true/false:
- bash, write, edit, read, grep, glob, list, task, WebFetch, TodoWrite, TodoRead
- Enables clear tool permission boundaries
- Improves agent capability understanding

### 2. Command General Context Pattern
All commands should include dynamic git context:
- Git Branch for branch awareness
- Git Status for modified file awareness
- Current Directory for path context
- Arguments for runtime parameter tracking

### 3. Agent Specialization Pattern
New agents follow clear specialization:
- logging: WRITE operations (session end)
- context-gathering: READ operations (session start)
- root-cause-analyst: DIAGNOSE operations (error investigation)
- generator-specialist: CREATE operations (framework expansion)
- refactoring-expert: IMPROVE operations (quality enhancement)

### 4. Dual MCP Integration Pattern
Session lifecycle now includes both Serena and In-Memoria:
- /load: READ from both MCPs (context + patterns)
- Work: Continuous pattern learning
- /save: WRITE to both MCPs (memories + insights)

## Architectural Decisions Made

### Decision: Complete Template Compliance Enforcement
**Rationale**: Ensures consistency across all framework components
**Impact**: All 10 agents and 6 commands updated to match templates exactly
**Trade-off**: Short-term effort for long-term maintainability

### Decision: TodoWrite for All Agents
**Rationale**: Universal progress tracking capability
**Impact**: Enables better task orchestration and progress visibility
**Trade-off**: Increased tool permissions for comprehensive tracking

### Decision: Logging Agent with Dual MCP
**Rationale**: Complement context-gathering with WRITE-focused specialist
**Impact**: Clean READ/WRITE separation for session lifecycle
**Trade-off**: Additional agent complexity for better architecture

### Decision: Root-Cause-Analyst Diagnose-Only
**Rationale**: Clear separation between diagnosis and implementation
**Impact**: Specialist agent for error investigation without fix implementation
**Trade-off**: Requires delegation to other agents for fixes

### Decision: Generator-Specialist as Meta-Agent
**Rationale**: Enable framework self-expansion capability
**Impact**: Automated template-compliant component generation
**Trade-off**: Meta-agent complexity for framework extensibility

## Quality Validation

✅ All agents: 100% template compliance (11-tool frontmatter)
✅ All commands: 100% template compliance (General Context + References)
✅ New agents: Complete documentation with all required sections
✅ New commands: Workflow, examples, integration documentation
✅ AGENTS.md: All components registered correctly
✅ Line limits: All files within template limits (agents ≤100, commands ≤100)

## Next Session Recommendations
