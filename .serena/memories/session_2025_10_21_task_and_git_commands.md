# Session: /task and /git Command Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Duration**: Extended implementation session with ultrathink analysis
**Focus**: Task management system + Git/Forgejo workflow system

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. /task Command + task-manager Agent

**Created Components:**
- `command/task.md` (64 lines) - Task management command interface
- `agent/task-manager.md` (76 lines) - Task decomposition specialist

**Design Analysis (Sequential MCP - 10 thought steps):**
- Clarified purpose: MANAGEMENT not implementation
- Established hierarchy: TodoWrite (atomic) → /task (complex) → /spawn (multi-agent)
- Defined agent-agnostic approach: Tasks represent WHAT, not HOW/WHO
- Integrated dual MCP: Serena (persistence) + In-Memoria (pattern learning)

**Key Features:**
- Hierarchical task decomposition (2-3 levels)
- Status tracking (not_started → in_progress → completed/blocked)
- Cross-session persistence via Serena memory
- Progress metrics and dependency tracking
- No execution coupling (pure management)

**Operations:**
```
/task <description>              # Create task breakdown
/task show [task_id]             # Display hierarchy
/task update <task_id> <status>  # Update status
/task complete <task_id>         # Mark complete
/task list                       # List all tasks
```

**Agent Specifications:**
- Mode: subagent (called by /task command)
- Reasoning: high (complex decomposition)
- Verbosity: low (structured output)
- Tools: read, grep, glob, list, TodoWrite, TodoRead
- MCP: Sequential (PRIMARY), Serena (CRITICAL), In-Memoria

**Success Metrics:**
- Decomposition quality: >90% logical and actionable
- Status accuracy: 100% correct progress calculation
- Persistence reliability: 100% successful memory operations
- Pattern learning: >80% valuable insights
- User clarity: >90% understandable structures

### 2. /git Command + git-specialist Agent

**Created Components:**
- `command/git.md` (80 lines) - Git workflow command interface
- `agent/git-specialist.md` (71 lines) - Git and Forgejo specialist

**Design Analysis (Sequential MCP - 10 thought steps):**
- Identified dual expertise: Local git + Forgejo forge integration
- Designed intelligent workflows: Not command wrappers, but workflow orchestration
- Established Forgejo MCP as primary integration point
- Created safety mechanisms: Preview destructive ops, graceful fallback

**Key Features:**
- Git mastery: Expert execution of all git operations
- Forgejo integration: Issues, PRs, branches, commits via MCP
- Intelligent PR descriptions: Auto-generate from commit analysis
- Branch context understanding: Analyze relationships and status
- Workflow automation: Feature → Issue → PR → Close lifecycle

**Operations:**
```
# Workflow Management
/git workflow feature <name>  # Create branch + issue
/git workflow pr              # Create PR with auto-description
/git workflow sync            # Sync local/remote

# Branch Operations  
/git branch create <name>     # Create local + remote

# Issue Integration
/git issue create <title>     # Create Forgejo issue
/git issue link <id>          # Link branch to issue
/git issue close <id>         # Close with verification

# PR Management
/git pr create                # Intelligent PR creation
/git pr update <id>           # Update PR
/git pr status                # Show status

# Commit Intelligence
/git commit smart             # Generate commit message
/git commit history           # Analyze history
```

**Agent Specifications:**
- Mode: subagent (called by /git command)
- Reasoning: medium (workflow analysis)
- Verbosity: low (concise output)
- Tools: bash (git commands), read, grep, glob, list
- MCP: Forgejo (PRIMARY), Sequential, Serena, In-Memoria

**Forgejo MCP Integration:**
- Repository: create_repo, fork_repo, list_my_repos
- Branches: list_branches, create_branch, delete_branch
- Issues: create_issue, update_issue, add_issue_labels, issue_state_change
- PRs: create_pull_request, list_repo_pull_requests, get_pull_request_by_index
- Commits: list_repo_commits
- Files: create_file, update_file, delete_file

**Success Metrics:**
- Git operation success: >95% without intervention
- Forgejo integration: 100% reliable API calls
- PR description quality: >90% accurate and meaningful
- Workflow efficiency: <30s for common workflows
- Safety: 0% data loss, 100% preview for destructive ops

### 3. Framework Enhancements

**Lifecycle Coverage:**
```
LOAD (context-gathering) → 
PLAN (task-manager) → 
EXECUTE (orchestration) → 
VERSION (git-specialist) → 
SAVE (logging)
```

**Agent Count Update:**
- Total agents: 12 sub-agents + 1 primary
- New agents: task-manager, git-specialist
- Framework now covers: context, planning, execution, version control, persistence

**Command Count Update:**
- Total commands: 9 operational commands
- New commands: /task, /git
- Coverage: load, save, spawn, troubleshoot, improve, generate, implement, task, git

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Task Management as Pure Management Layer
**Rationale**: Separate planning/tracking from execution
**Impact**: Clean separation between WHAT (tasks) and HOW (implementation)
**Trade-off**: Additional abstraction for better organization
**Integration**: Works with TodoWrite (execution) and /spawn (coordination)

### Decision: Git-Specialist as Forge Bridge
**Rationale**: Integrate local git expertise with Forgejo forge operations
**Impact**: Complete development workflow in single agent
**Trade-off**: Complex integration for comprehensive capability
**Integration**: Only agent with Forgejo MCP access

### Decision: Sequential MCP for Both Agents
**Rationale**: Complex analysis required for decomposition and workflow intelligence
**Impact**: High-quality task breakdowns and PR descriptions
**Trade-off**: Additional reasoning time for better outcomes

### Decision: Agent-Agnostic Task System
**Rationale**: Tasks don't dictate execution approach
**Impact**: Flexibility in how work gets done
**Trade-off**: Looser coupling requires manual execution tracking

## Template Compliance

**Validation Results:**
✅ task-manager agent: 76 lines (< 100 limit)
✅ task command: 64 lines (< 100 limit)
✅ git-specialist agent: 71 lines (< 100 limit)
✅ git command: 80 lines (< 100 limit)
✅ All YAML frontmatter: Complete and correct
✅ General Context: Dynamic git info included
✅ References: FLAGS.md linked
✅ AGENTS.md: Both sets registered alphabetically

## Quality Metrics

**Sequential MCP Analysis:**
- task-manager: 10 thought steps (comprehensive decomposition)
- git-specialist: 10 thought steps (workflow and integration analysis)
- Total reasoning: 20 structured thought sequences

**Design Quality:**
- Clear boundaries and responsibilities
