# Session: Domain-Specific Agent Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Focus**: Implementation of 5 domain-specific engineering agents

## Agents Created

All agents follow agent.template.md pattern, exactly 70 lines each (under 100-line limit):

### 1. **frontend-engineer.md** (70 lines)
- **Purpose**: UI development with accessibility, performance, framework best practices
- **Reasoning**: Medium (complex UI logic, state management)
- **MCP Stack**: shadcn (components), Context7 (frameworks), Playwright (testing), Sequential (architecture), Morphllm (bulk updates)
- **Key Metrics**: WCAG 2.1 AA >95%, Lighthouse >90, >80% component reuse, <200KB bundles, >85% test coverage

### 2. **backend-engineer.md** (70 lines)
- **Purpose**: API development, database design, server-side logic, authentication
- **Reasoning**: Medium (API design, data modeling complexity)
- **MCP Stack**: Context7 (frameworks), Sequential (data flows), Serena (symbols), Playwright (API testing), Forgejo (deployment)
- **Key Metrics**: >99.9% uptime, <200ms response, 100% input validation, >80% coverage, <50ms queries

### 3. **devops-engineer.md** (70 lines)
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure automation, CI/CD, monitoring, deployment strategies
- **Reasoning**: Low (config-driven, declarative)
- **MCP Stack**: Forgejo (CI/CD), Context7 (IaC patterns), Sequential (deployment strategy), Chrome DevTools (profiling), Serena (config tracking)
- **Key Metrics**: Multiple deploys/day, <5min pipeline, >99% deploy success, 100% IaC, <15min MTTR

### 4. **security-engineer.md** (70 lines)
- **Purpose**: Vulnerability scanning, secure auth, compliance, threat modeling
- **Reasoning**: High (threat analysis, security strategy)
- **MCP Stack**: Sequential (threat modeling), Serena (security analysis), Context7 (best practices), Playwright (security testing), Tavily (threat intel)
- **Key Metrics**: Critical fixes in 7 days, 100% endpoint auth, zero critical deps, OWASP compliance, automated security scans

### 5. **qa-engineer.md** (70 lines)
- **Purpose**: Test strategy, automation, quality metrics, regression prevention
- **Reasoning**: Medium (test strategy, scenario design)
- **MCP Stack**: Playwright (E2E), Context7 (test frameworks), Sequential (strategy), Chrome DevTools (debugging), Serena (test organization)
- **Key Metrics**: >85% meaningful coverage, <2% flaky rate, <5min test suite, >90% defect detection, zero regression

## Architecture Decisions

### Agent Taxonomy
- **Domain Coverage**: 5 core engineering domains with non-overlapping responsibilities
- **Expertise Distribution**: Frontend (UI), Backend (APIs), DevOps (Infrastructure), Security (Vulnerabilities), QA (Testing)
- **Reasoning Levels**: Low (DevOps config-driven) → Medium (Frontend/Backend/QA) → High (Security threat modeling)

### Design Patterns
- **Template Compliance**: All agents follow agent.template.md exactly (YAML → Triggers → Focus → Tools → MCP → Boundaries → Metrics)
- **Line Limit**: 70 lines each (30% under 100-line maximum)
- **MCP Integration**: Each agent has 5 relevant MCP integrations for domain expertise
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable, domain-specific, actionable (percentages, time, scores)

### MCP Specialization Strategy
- **Frontend**: shadcn (UI registry), Context7 (React/Vue), Playwright (accessibility)
- **Backend**: Context7 (Express/FastAPI), Serena (symbols), Forgejo (deployment)
- **DevOps**: Forgejo (CI/CD primary), Chrome DevTools (profiling), Context7 (IaC)
- **Security**: Sequential (threat modeling primary), Tavily (threat intel), Serena (analysis)
- **QA**: Playwright (E2E primary), Context7 (Jest/Vitest), Chrome DevTools (debugging)

## Implementation Approach

### Sequential MCP Analysis (12 thoughts)
1. Pattern analysis: Template structure, context-gathering reference
2. Agent design: 5 domains (frontend, backend, devops, security, qa)
3-6. Domain expertise mapping: Triggers, Focus Areas, Tools, MCP per agent
7. Reasoning levels: DevOps low, Frontend/Backend/QA medium, Security high
8. Line budget: 71 lines max (YAML 13 + sections ~7 each = ~71 total)
9. YAML structure: mode=subagent, write=true, textVerbosity=low
10. MCP appropriateness: shadcn for UI, Forgejo for CI/CD, Sequential for analysis
11. Domain boundaries: Clear non-overlapping responsibilities
12. Success metrics: Measurable percentages, time, scores

### Parallel Implementation
- Created all 5 agents simultaneously using parallel Write calls
- Updated AGENTS.md with alphabetical agent imports
- Validated line counts: All exactly 70 lines

## Files Modified

**Created** (5 files):
- agent/backend-engineer.md (70 lines)
- agent/devops-engineer.md (70 lines)
- agent/frontend-engineer.md (70 lines)
- agent/qa-engineer.md (70 lines)
- agent/security-engineer.md (70 lines)

**Updated** (1 file):
- AGENTS.md: Added 5 agent imports in Sub Agents section

## Quality Validation

✅ All agents exactly 70 lines (under 100-line limit)
✅ All agents follow agent.template.md structure
✅ All agents have domain-specific MCP integrations
✅ All agents have measurable success metrics
✅ AGENTS.md updated with all imports
✅ Non-overlapping domain responsibilities
✅ Appropriate reasoning effort levels
