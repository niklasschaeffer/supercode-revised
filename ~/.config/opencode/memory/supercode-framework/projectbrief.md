# SuperCode Framework - Project Brief

## Project Overview
SuperCode is a sophisticated AI agent orchestration framework built for modern development workflows. It provides 19 specialized agents, 13 commands, and 11 MCP server integrations to create a comprehensive AI-assisted development environment.

## Core Mission
To create an intelligent, modular framework that enables seamless AI-human collaboration in software development through specialized agent coordination and comprehensive tool integration.

## Key Objectives
1. **Agent Specialization**: Provide domain-specific AI agents for every development phase
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Enable complex multi-agent task coordination
3. **Tool Integration**: Integrate best-in-class development tools through MCP servers
4. **Quality Assurance**: Build comprehensive validation and compliance systems
5. **Developer Experience**: Create intuitive command interfaces and behavioral controls

## Architecture Philosophy
- **Modular Design**: Each agent has clear boundaries and specific responsibilities
- **Template Standardization**: Consistent structure across all components
- **Behavioral Control**: Fine-grained flag system for execution customization
- **Dual Memory Architecture**: Persistent knowledge management through Memory Bank and Knowledge Graph
- **Quality First**: Built-in validation, testing, and compliance frameworks

## Technology Foundation
- **Runtime**: Node.js 16.0.0+ with TypeScript 5.2.2
- **Build System**: Vite 5.0.8 with advanced optimization
- **Frontend**: React 18.2.0 + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E testing with visual regression
- **Integration**: OpenCode plugin with 11 MCP servers

## Success Metrics
- 19 specialized agents covering complete development lifecycle
- 13 commands for comprehensive workflow management
- 11 MCP server integrations for extensive capabilities
- 100% template compliance across all components
- Dual memory architecture for persistent intelligence

## Strategic Value
SuperCode represents a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development, moving from single-purpose AI tools to an orchestrated ecosystem of specialized agents working in harmony with human developers.
