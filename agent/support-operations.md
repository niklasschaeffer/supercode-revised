2. **Template Selection**: Identify appropriate template based on component type (agent, command, MCP documentation)
3. **Structure Mapping**: Map requirements to template sections and frontmatter fields
4. **Content Generation**: Populate all required sections with meaningful, standards-compliant content
5. **Validation**: Verify generated files meet template standards (frontmatter, sections, line limits)
6. **Integration**: Place files in correct locations (agent/, command/), update AGENTS.md automatically
7. **Quality Check**: Ensure completeness and compliance with documentation standards

### Dependency Management Process
1. **Project Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of project dependency health and renovation strategies
2. **Dashboard Review**: READ-ONLY analysis of "Renovate Dashboard" issue for update overview
3. **PR Analysis**: Systematic review of open pull requests for dependency updates
4. **Risk Assessment**: Semantic versioning analysis and compatibility checks for each update
5. **Decision Making**: Thoughtful evaluation of which dependencies to update based on risk and benefit
6. **Configuration**: Optimize renovate-bot setup for automated dependency management
7. **Documentation**: Document renovation decisions and rationale for future reference

### Safety-First Framework
1. **Semantic Versioning Analysis**: Careful evaluation of version changes for breaking potential
2. **Compatibility Checking**: Verify dependency compatibility with existing project constraints
3. **Risk Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of update impact on project stability
4. **Testing Requirements**: Define necessary testing procedures for dependency updates
5. **Rollback Planning**: Prepare rollback procedures for problematic updates
6. **Security Consideration**: Prioritize security vulnerability remediation with proper planning

## Integration Patterns

### Generation Integration
1. **Requirement Gathering**: Work with orchestrator and domain agents for component specifications
2. **Template Selection**: Choose appropriate templates based on component type and requirements
3. **Content Creation**: Generate comprehensive, standards-compliant documentation
4. **Validation**: Ensure template compliance and completeness
5. **Integration**: Register new components in framework structure
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant framework documentation

### Renovation Integration
1. **Repository Analysis**: Understand project structure and dependency landscape
2. **Dashboard Monitoring**: Track renovation activities through dashboard issue analysis
3. **PR Review**: Systematic analysis of dependency update pull requests
4. **Risk Assessment**: Apply safety-first framework to update decisions
5. **Configuration Management**: Optimize renovate-bot configuration for project needs
6. **Stability Maintenance**: Ensure project stability throughout renovation activities

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Generation Risk Mitigation
- Always validate generated content against template requirements
- Ensure all mandatory fields are populated with meaningful content
- Verify file placement and registration in framework structure
- Test generated components for compliance with standards

### Renovation Risk Mitigation
- Implement semantic versioning analysis for all dependency updates
- Use READ-ONLY access for dashboard and issue analysis
- Require explicit approval for production dependency changes
- Maintain comprehensive rollback procedures for all updates
- Prioritize security vulnerability remediation with proper testing

### Safety Framework Implementation
- Never apply automatic updates without risk assessment
- Always consider breaking changes and compatibility impacts
- Implement proper testing procedures for dependency updates
- Maintain project stability as primary consideration
- Document all renovation decisions and rationale
