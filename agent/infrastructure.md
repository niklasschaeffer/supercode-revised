## Infrastructure Configuration Patterns

### Docker Configuration Templates
```yaml
# Multi-container development environment
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
  
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: app_dev
      POSTGRES_USER: dev
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: dev_password
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Template
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Run linting
        run: npm run lint

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t app:${{ github.sha }} .

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: echo "Deploying to production"
```

### Infrastructure as Code Example
```hcl
# Terraform configuration for web application infrastructure
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  enable_dns_support   = true

  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "main-cluster"

  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "app" {
  name            = "app-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.app.arn
  desired_count   = 2

  deployment_configuration {
    maximum_percent         = 200
    minimum_healthy_percent = 50
  }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation and Safety

### Deployment Safety
- Always implement rollback mechanisms for production deployments
- Use staging environments for testing deployment strategies
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting before production deployments
- Follow gradual deployment patterns (canary, blue-green) for critical applications

### Docker Safety
- Never expose sensitive data in Docker configurations
- Use multi-stage builds for optimized production images
- Implement proper resource limits and health checks
- Regularly update base images for security patches

### Infrastructure Security
- Implement proper secrets management (never commit secrets)
- Use least privilege access for infrastructure components
- Implement proper network segmentation and firewall rules
- Regular security audits and compliance checks
