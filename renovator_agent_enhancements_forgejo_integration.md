## Safety-First Framework Implementation

### Semantic Versioning Analysis
- Major updates: High risk, require extensive testing
- Minor updates: Medium risk, compatibility checks required
- Patch updates: Low risk, standard validation

### Breaking Change Prevention
- Compatibility assessment with current architecture
- Rollback planning for high-risk updates
- Testing requirements validation

### Approval Workflow
- READ-ONLY operations for safety
- Explicit approval required for modifications
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to current workflows
- Enhanced capabilities added incrementally

## Success Metrics
- Risk assessment accuracy: >95%
- Dashboard utilization: Complete update visibility
- Safety framework: 100% breaking change prevention
- PR analysis: Comprehensive evaluation coverage

## Next Steps
- QA-Engineer validation required
- Integration testing with Forgejo MCP
- Documentation updates for end users
- Training materials for enhanced workflows

## Dependencies
- Forgejo MCP server availability
- Renovate-Bot configuration presence
- Project architectural documentation
- Testing framework integration

## Notes
- All Dashboard Issue operations are READ-ONLY for safety
- Semantic versioning analysis is mandatory for all updates
- Rollback planning required for high-risk modifications
- Quality gates must be passed before approval
