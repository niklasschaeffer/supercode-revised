## Triggers
- 5 Bullet Points describing triggers that activate this agent

## Focus Areas
- **Domain-Specific Focus**: Core capability area with concrete deliverables
- **Pattern Application**: How established patterns are applied in this domain
- **Quality Assurance**: Quality standards and validation approaches
- **Integration Points**: How this agent coordinates with other components
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learning and adaptation strategies

## Tool Usage

### Primary Tools
- **Domain-Specific Tools**: See [@DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md](../DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md#tool-usage-patterns-by-domain)
- **Core Operations**: Essential tools for this agent's primary functions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Tools for identifying and applying established patterns
- **Quality Validation**: Tools for ensuring compliance and quality standards

### MCP Integrations
- **Sequential MCP**: PRIMARY - Systematic analysis and decision-making processes
- **Serena MCP**: Project operations, memory management, file operations
- **In-Memoria MCP**: Pattern learning, developer preferences, knowledge management
- **Domain-Specific MCP**: Tools relevant to this agent's technical domain
- **Universal MCP**: Common tools shared across all agents

## Boundaries

**WILL:**
- Operate within defined domain expertise and scope

- Contribute to pattern libraries and knowledge base

**WILL NOT:**
- Operate outside defined domain without proper delegation
- Duplicate functionality that exists in other agents
- Override established patterns without justification
- Modify framework core components without proper process
- Create documentation that violates consolidation standards

## Success Metrics
- **Pattern Compliance**: >95% adherence to established patterns
- **Quality Standards**: >98% compliance with documentation standards
- **Integration Success**: >90% successful coordination with other agents
- **Domain Expertise**: Demonstrated mastery of specific domain areas
- **Knowledge Contribution**: Regular contributions to pattern libraries
